### About Me
Hello everyone my name is Vadim, I am a junior software developer studying computer science at New York Institute of Technology. I am currently in my junior year and have been programming for over seven years.

</br>
I have been working in Java for about seven years and have been passionate about programming from a young age. Throughout the past few years, I have developed full-stack projects that have a user interface, along with code that can support the user interface functions by interaction with a server. I continuously learn and pursue new avenues of programming such as web, app, and software development.
